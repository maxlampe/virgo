# Virgo

_virgo_ (**V**ariational **I**nference package for unsupe**R**vised classification of (inter-)**G**alactic sh**O**ck waves)
is a Python package for [...] data.


## Project status

This project is very much WIP and changes are constantly being made. Feel free to contact [me](mailto:max.lamparth@tum.de?subject=virgo) for feedback and issues.
Currently, even core features are still implemented and can be subject to change.

## Usage

### Installation

Get the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/maxlampe/virgo) and install it locally, as there is no pip release.

Python version 3.8 or above required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxlampe/virgo
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e path-to-virgo-dir
```

### Getting started

Talk about demo notebooks and docstring calls.

### Data files

Give drive links to used data in paper.

## Development

### Design decisions

1. Style guide: [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
2. Docstring convention: [numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
3. Ideally, you should use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) as code formatter.

**Maximum line length is 88** (default black enforced line length).

### Unit tests

None are implemented yet.
